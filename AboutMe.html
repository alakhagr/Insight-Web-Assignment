   		I am an Enthusiast. <br> Someone who loves working behind the wheels to get to the root of 'how things work'?
        <br> Currently trying to explore the Majestic World of Computers, I am working on multiple projects related to Web Development, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Reinforcment Learning.

        	In my ITSP project, I am working with my team to develop a Machine Learning and Computer Vision based model to detect the stress levels of 'Work from Home' employees and students. This would allow us to see the user's ongoind camera feed and detect if he/she feels stressed due to continuous screen time and and evaluate their schedule and screen time. We will also try to suggest some changes in his/her timetable for a more balanced routine. We plan to integrate this whole model in a web framework such that it can be easily accesible to our clients anywhere and anytime.
        	<br> <br>
        	In my SoC project, I am working under my mentors to develop a Reinforcement Learning based agent to ace the arcade game 'PACMAN'.
